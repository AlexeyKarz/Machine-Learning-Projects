This is a Data Science and Machine Learning project: 
1. A study of the factors (various characteristics) that affect vehicle CO2 emissions in Canada.
2. Building a model capable of predicting the amount of CO2 emissions a vehicle produces

The project was made as part of a Python programming course at the Higher School of Economics University. It was further developed after completing the course from ZTM: Complete Machine Learning & Data Science Bootcamp 2023

The data for this project is taken from Kaggle
