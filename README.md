# Data Science and Machine Learning projects
This repository showcases my journey through different domains, applying various machine learning models and techniques to solve real-world problems. Each project is documented, and includes both the code and a comprehensive analysis.

## Projects overview:

### 1. [**Brain Stroke Classifier**](https://github.com/AlexeyKarz/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/brain-stroke-classiffier) 
A machine learning project focused on predicting the occurrence of brain strokes. The project applies Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest models, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, comparison, and fine-tuning. **Models used - Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest**. 
### 2. [**CO2 Emissions**](https://github.com/AlexeyKarz/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/co2-emissions-regression) 
This project investigates the factors affecting vehicle CO2 emissions in Canada and constructs a Random Forest regression model to predict the emissions based on various features. It includes feature engineering, EDA, visualization, hypothesis testing, model building, and fine-tuning. **Model used: Random Forest**. 
### 3. [**Stock Price Prediction**](https://github.com/AlexeyKarz/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/stock-price-prediction) 
Utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks implemented with Keras, this project aims to predict Apple Inc.'s stock prices. The project encompasses data preprocessing, model building and training, evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, visualization, and model persistence. **Model used: LSTM** model implemented with Keras. 
### 4. [**Mail Spam Classifier**](https://github.com/AlexeyKarz/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/mail-spam-classifier) 
A text classification project to identify spam emails. It explores different models, including TF-IDF Vectorization with Multinomial Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and LSTM networks using TensorFlow and Keras, covering data preprocessing, visualization, model training, evaluation, fine-tuning, and testing on custom data. **Models used: TF-IDF Vectorization + Multinomial Naive Bayes, SVM, TensorFlow and Keras:LSTM**.
### 5. [**Medical Abstracts: Sequential Sentence Classification**](https://github.com/AlexeyKarz/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/MedAbstracts_sequent.ipynb) 
Replicating and extending the work of Franck Dernoncourt and Ji Young Lee's 2017 [study](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06071#) on sequential sentence classification in medical abstracts. It leverages the 'PubMed 200k RCT' dataset to explore and evaluate different natural language processing (NLP) models for structuring abstracts into coherent segments. Inspired by methodologies from and guided by the Zero to Mastery [TensorFlow course](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/tree/main), particularly the SkimLit project. **The best model: TensorFlow model with character, token and positional embedding layers**.
### 6. [**Dog Vision Project**](https://github.com/AlexeyKarz/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/dog-vision-project.ipynb)  
A deep learning project utilizing Transfer Learning with TensorFlow to classify dog breeds. The model, based on mobilenet_v2_130_224 from TensorFlow Hub and trained on the ImageNet database, demonstrates the power of transfer learning in image classification tasks. **Model used - mobilenet_v2_130_224** from TensorFlow Hub. \
   *Note: The project implements methods used in TensorFlow 2.2. Model works, however, some parts of code might seem outdated.*
   *The project was build during completing the bootcamp. The bootcamp's project can be found [here](https://github.com/mrdbourke/zero-to-mastery-ml/blob/master/section-4-unstructured-data-projects/end-to-end-dog-vision.ipynb)*
