# Machine-Learning-Projects
The repository contains my data science and machine learning projects.

## Projects overview:

1. **Brain Stroke Classifier** - Building a (binary) classification model that predicts whether the person had a Brain Stroke. **Models used - Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest**. Project composition: EDA, Feature Engineering, Model building, training, evaluation and comparisom. Model fine-tuning, Feature improtance calculating.
2. **CO2 Emissions** - 1. A study of the factors that could affect vehicle's CO2 emission (In Canada) 2. Building a regression model that predicts the amount of CO2 emissions vehicle produced. Model used: **Random Forest**. Project composition: Feature Engineering, EDA, Visualization, Typothesis testing, Building a model, Model fine-tuning.
3. **Stock Price Prediction** - Building a model that predicts prices of stocks (AAPL) using **LSTM** model implemented with Keras. Project composition: Preprocessing, Building and training the model, Evaluation and Hyperparameter tuning, Visualization, Saving the model.
4. **Dog Vision Project** - Building a model that classifies dog breeds using Tranfer Learning and TensorFlow. **Model used - mobilenet_v2_130_224** from TensorFlow Hub, which was trained on ImageNet database. *The project was build during compleeting the bootcamp. The bootcamp's project could be found [here](https://github.com/mrdbourke/zero-to-mastery-ml/blob/master/section-4-unstructured-data-projects/end-to-end-dog-vision.ipynb)*
