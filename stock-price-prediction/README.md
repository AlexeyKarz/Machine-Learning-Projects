Project: Stock Price Prediction with LSTM using Keras

This project showcases a stock price prediction model developed using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks implemented with Keras. The goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in machine learning, time series analysis, and deep learning while providing a practical solution for predicting stock prices. 

Key Features:

LSTM Model: I implement a powerful LSTM-based deep learning model capable of capturing complex temporal patterns in stock price data.
Hyperparameter Tuning: I mannualy fine-tune the model's hyperparameters to optimize its performance. Hyperparameter tuning is a crucial skill for achieving better model accuracy.
Data Preprocessing: I preprocess historical stock price data, including filtering, scaling, and creating sequences suitable for time series prediction.
Model Evaluation: I evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Understanding model evaluation metrics is essential for assessing model accuracy.
GitHub Repository: The project is well-structured within this GitHub repository, making it easy to understand, reproduce, and build upon.
